# Nodejs Developer Test

## Finished Tasks

- Create an endpoint that allows the listing of the countries using the method from `src/api/country.ts`
  - `GET /countries/error-prone`
- Create an endpoint to fetch all of the countries sorted by their population
  - `GET /countries?sort={ desc (default) | asc }`
- Allow the populations to be updated
  - `PUT/PATCH /countries/:countryCode`
- Allow countries to be updated
  - `PUT/PATCH /countries/:countryCode` (to update an individual country)
  - `POST /countries` (to add a country)
- Allow countries to be deleted
  - `DELETE /countries/:countryCode`
- Add authentication using the `src/api/authenticate.ts` method
  - `POST /users/login`
- Storing the data in Redis
  - Redis instance can be configured via the `REDIS_URL` environment variable, also pre-configured in `docker-compose`
- Allowing the app to be run from a docker-compose file
  - `docker-compose.yml` for development (use public `node:14`, `redis:latest` images, runs `nodemon`, can auto-populate redis and auto-generate JWT signing keys)
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production (builds custom Docker image with transpiled code, does not auto-populate redis and auto-generate JWT signing keys)

## Testing Notes
- Please provide a `.env` file; simply copying `.env.example` would suffice.
- Running `docker-compose up` with an `.env` file with the same values as `.env.example` will set up a development environment with populated data and required files (please set `DEV_INIT_REDIS` and/or `DEV_INIT_JWT` to toggle this behavior).
- Redis can be auto-populated by running `yarn init:redis`, please make sure `REDIS_URL` environment variable is set.
- JWT signing keys can be auto-generated by running `yarn init:jwt`, please make sure `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` environment variables are set.

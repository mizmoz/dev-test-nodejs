# Nodejs Developer Test

## The Task

Create a simple node service that provides provides some endpoints to allow the listing and updating of a
list of countries and their population. This task should take 2-3 hours but don't worry if you aren't able to 
complete all items, just make sure to show your understanding of the core technologies we use.

1. Fork this repo
2. Create an endpoint that allows the listing of the countries using the method from `src/api/country.ts`
    * endpoint is /src/api/country
3. Create an endpoint to fetch all of the countries sorted by their population
    * GET /country?sort=population&direction=asc
4. Allow the populations to be updated
    * PUT /country/id
5. Allow countries to be updated
    * PUT /country/id
6. Allow countries to be deleted 
    * DEL /country/id
7. Add authentication using the `src/api/authenticate.ts` method
8. When you're done commit your code and create a pull request

Bonus points for

1. Storing the data in Redis
2. Allowing the app to be run from a docker-compose file
  * used mongodb
